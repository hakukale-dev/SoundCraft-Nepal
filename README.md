#  SoundCraft Nepal

Hey there!   
This is my **final year project** – an e-commerce platform built specifically for musicians in Nepal. I wanted to create something practical, and since I'm passionate about music and tech, this project felt like the perfect fit.

SoundCraft Nepal lets users browse and buy musical instruments, book repair or maintenance services, and even pay online using eSewa, Khalti or option for Cash on Delivery. It’s got features like cart, wishlist, order tracking, and an admin panel for managing products and stock.

I built this using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and integrated tools like Cloudinary for image uploads and Nodemailer for sending confirmation emails.
